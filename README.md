# GTBox
GTBox is an ecosystem framework, combining a suite of our own developed modules and software packages with other open-source tools like Mininet, Wireshark, Hping3, ..etc. This powerful mix is designed to streamline and professionalize the research process.

To understand/get the idea well: Imagine youâ€™re a researcher keen on exploring DDoS attack detection and mitigation through machine learning. With GTBox, you can experiment with different datasets, techniques, and models. It also allows you to benchmark your own model with similar works. In short, GTBox is the go-to tool for researchers seeking to advance their work with efficiency and precision.
