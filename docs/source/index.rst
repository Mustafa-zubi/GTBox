Welcome to GTBox's documentation!
=================================

Welcome to the GTBox: your premier destination for attack detection and mitigation research. It is open-source software hub that is dedicated to help researchers with the tools they need to efficiently run and test their attack detection and mitigation models. GTBox adds its flaiver to ensure you receive detailed, standardized reports, making it easier to analyze and refine your strategies. 

This initiative began -- small -- in the fall of 2023 at PSUT University, by two PhD students, Sarah Khader and Mustafa Alzubi, as part of their coursework in Computer and Network Security. The course, under the guidance of Dr. Sufyan Almajali, who also supervised this project, laid the foundation for this groundbreaking endeavor.

Although our project started small, we're **optimistic** about its future. We believe that as more researchers **get involved**, it will become a really important tool for everyone working in cybersecurity research.... please take a seat on the table. 

GTBox? you might find yourself wondering about the origins of its name. What does GTBox stand for? Well, hold onto your curiosity, as we **promise to unveil** this secret at the most opportune moment. Stay tuned!
